# Building detection lab with ELASTIC-STACK

## Objective

This project demonstrates how to use Elastic Stack (ELK) for incident response. It simulates security incidents on both Linux and Windows systems, showing how Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana can be used to collect, analyze, and visualize logs. The goal is to install Elasticstack, configure it, and provide a practical example of how Elastic Stack helps in detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats.

### Skills Learned

- Building a virtual enviroment. 
- Installing elastic search, kibana, logstach, and configure them.
- Deploying agents in Vm client, such as winlogbeat, packetbeat, elastic-agent.
- Visualizeing logs recieved from the agents.
- Incident detection with elastic deffend alerts.
  
### Tools Used


- Virtualbox (setting up the virtual enviroment).
- Winrar (Merging a payload with an image).
- Winscp (Moving files between VMs).
- Putty.
